Testing notes:
1. World
    - outline shape
        - with content
        - without content
    - colision shape
        - 1 layers
        - 2 layers
        - 5 layers
        - 8 layers
        - with content
        - without content
        - walk
        - jump
        - fall

2. Snowing (weather rain)
    - snow falls on ground
    - snow falls on snowloggable
    - snow accumulate on itself
    - snow accumulate on snowloggable
3. Right click
    - right click ground
    - right click snowloggable
    - right click snowierblock with content
    - right click snowierblock without content * check for collision


Scenarios to check
Non-growing plant blocks(Poppy, grass)
- route A(dynamic) - only lets stay if block below is dirt)
- route B(static) - is "frozen" in snow does not care about dirt


TODO:
 - refactor getting of content/check if empty etc.
 - general refactor afterwards


FEATURES:
 - make all desired blocks work as static
 - add "frozen" textures
 - make snow particles bringers maybe even C00lER 8)?



//ALL FUTURE SNOWLOGGABLE BLOCKS
-Anvil

TODO-FIRST-ITERATION
-Static plants
-Double static plants
-Berry Bush
-Bambooo
-Sugar Cane
-Saplings

TODO-SECOND-ITERATION
-Fence
-Wall
-Pane


DONE:
- snowfall stacking fixed
- translation
- replace vanilla snow
- check snow gen under trees
- when placing vanilla snow place modded snow instead

LAST:
- remove "instance of SnowBlock" etc. prob with a tag

TODO:
- add snowfallable tag
- snow content drop / snow drop
- snow melt
- config
    - max snow layers
    - snow stacking
    - snowloggable blocks
    - snow falling speed
    - snowfall passable blocks(fences etc)
- pre-calc whenever possible
- never ending refactoring
- speed up freezetoplayer feature(unsure)
- prob more...
